      # Transfer
      # - For transfer tests, there is one account with tokens from 1 to 100.
      # - The numbers below is which token ID to transfer. Each number in the

      #   affects a few implementations like ERC721A.
      transfer: [1, 10, 50, 100]
      # Approve
      # - same logic as Transfer, but for approval, the numbers below are token ids
      approve: [1, 10, 50, 100]
      # Burn
      # - same logic as Transfer, but for burn, the numbers below are token ids
      burn: [1, 10, 50, 100]

      # Mint
      # - The numbers below are the amount to mint. Each number in the array will
      #   generate a test mining the number.
